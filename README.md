# Universal Linked List

Universal linked list is decentralised image-board like format for threads
hosted with [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

Because of the way IPFS works, once threads are created, they will exist for as
long as someone is hosting them.

## How it works

Each thread is an [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) linked list-like data structure with
messages as its nodes.
